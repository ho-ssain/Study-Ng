# Angular

## What is Angular?

--> open-source JS Framework
--> created and maintained by Google
--> completely written in TS
--> best for developing SPA

## What is TypeScript?

--> TS is a Super-set of JS
--> enhanced version of JS with additional features
--> gets compiled to JS at the end

## Why do we need a Framework?

--> easy for maintaining code
--> easy to structure our code in modules
--> code reuse
--> everything in one place

## Why do we need Angular Framework?

--> Angular is a framework
--> it is TS based
--> powerfull CLI
--> two-way binding
--> MVC based framework
--> uses Dependency injection

## SPA vs TWA

Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Traditional Web Applications are two different approaches to building web applications, each with its own set of characteristics and advantages. Here are some key points of comparison between SPAs and traditional web apps:

**Single Page Applications (SPAs):**

1. **Page Loading:**

   - **Characteristics:** SPAs load a single HTML page and dynamically update content as the user interacts with the application.
   - **Advantages:** Faster initial loading times as only the required data is fetched, and subsequent interactions feel quicker due to reduced server round-trips.

2. **User Experience:**

   - **Characteristics:** SPAs provide a more seamless and fluid user experience, as there is no full page reload during navigation.
   - **Advantages:** Enhanced user experience similar to that of a desktop application. Smooth transitions and interactions without noticeable delays.

3. **Server Communication:**

   - **Characteristics:** SPAs often rely heavily on AJAX or Fetch API to communicate with the server asynchronously, fetching only the necessary data.
   - **Advantages:** Reduced bandwidth usage and faster response times, especially for small updates or partial page changes.

4. **Frameworks:**

   - **Characteristics:** SPAs are commonly built using JavaScript frameworks and libraries like Angular, React, or Vue.js.
   - **Advantages:** These frameworks provide a structured way to build complex applications and manage state, making development more organized and scalable.

5. **State Management:**
   - **Characteristics:** SPAs often employ client-side state management to keep track of the application state without relying on server-side sessions.
   - **Advantages:** Improved responsiveness as the application can update in real-time based on user interactions without reloading the entire page.

**Traditional Web Applications:**

1. **Page Loading:**

   - **Characteristics:** Traditional web applications load a new HTML page from the server each time the user navigates to a different part of the application.
   - **Advantages:** Simplicity in terms of navigation and straightforward server-side rendering.

2. **User Experience:**

   - **Characteristics:** Traditional web apps may experience full-page reloads during navigation, leading to a perceptible delay.
   - **Advantages:** Suitable for content-heavy websites where SEO is a primary concern. Each page has a unique URL, making it easy to share and index by search engines.

3. **Server Communication:**

   - **Characteristics:** Traditional web apps typically rely on synchronous requests, leading to full page reloads.
   - **Advantages:** Better support for browsers without JavaScript enabled. Compatibility with older browsers and simpler server-side architecture.

4. **Frameworks:**

   - **Characteristics:** Traditional web apps can be built using various server-side frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, or ASP.NET.
   - **Advantages:** Well-suited for applications with more static content and simpler client-server interactions.

5. **State Management:**
   - **Characteristics:** Traditional web apps often rely on server-side sessions to manage user state.
   - **Advantages:** Easier to implement secure session handling and server-side business logic.

In summary, the choice between SPA and traditional web app architecture depends on factors such as the nature of the application, the desired user experience, the complexity of interactions, and development preferences. SPAs are well-suited for highly interactive and dynamic applications, while traditional web apps may be preferred for content-centric or SEO-focused websites.
